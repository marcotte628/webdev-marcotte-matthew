Hi there!

My name is Matt and this is my second semester as a Grad Student here at Northeastern. I an originally 
from Acton, Massachusetts, and am currently living in North Hampton, New Hampshire. I am currently 
enrolled in Managing Software Development and the Co-op Seminar alongside Web Development. I did my undergrad
at Miami University, which is in Ohio, about an hour drive's north of Cincinnati. I entered college with 
an undeclared engineering major, and settled on Computer Science during my Sophomore year. I took two Web
Development courses at Miami and found the topic super interesting! I can't wait to learn more and become a 
better Web Developer this semester!

The purpose of this repository is to store the source code for Web Application that we are currently working
on. Using this repository allows multiple parties to access the code in order to review, edit, make comments
on, while keeping everything in one place. GitHub allows all contributers of a project, such as this, to 
checkout others' updates as well as push their own updates. Creating different branches allows users to work
off of the master branch, which means things can be tweaked or broken without risk of harming the original.
When branches are perfected and ready to be added to the master branch, it is simple to merge the two branches
and have a newly updated working copy of the application.

# AngularFourMEANSeed

After you clone this repository and run "npm install"
To start the project
Open two terminals, One to start the front end, One to start the backend

~ npm start


~ nodemon server.js

Front end will run on `http://localhost:4200/`
Server will run on port 3100. Specified in server.js and in environment.ts files







## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
